## 📌 Abstract

Vegetation-based soil reinforcement is a sustainable and effective approach for enhancing slope stability; however, predicting the mechanical response of root-reinforced soils remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions between hydrological and mechanical factors. This study develops a two-phase machine learning (ML) framework to estimate the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soils reinforced with Nandina domestica roots. In the first phase, Direct Shear Test (DST) data were modeled to predict soil shear stress and shear settlement under varying normal stresses, moisture contents, root weight densities, and depths. These DST-derived parameters were then integrated into the second phase to predict UCS, establishing a data-driven linkage between shear and compressive behavior. A comprehensive comparison of advanced ML algorithms—including LightGBM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest—was conducted against traditional regression techniques. Ensemble models outperformed the linear counterparts, with Gradient Boosting achieving the highest predictive accuracy (test R2 = 0.96, CV R2 = 0.98). Feature importance analysis identified moisture content as the most influential parameter governing soil strength, exceeding the structural contribution of root weight density. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reliable predictive tool for bio-engineering applications, facilitating the design and optimization of root-reinforced systems for slope stabilization and erosion control.
